# Absu-Marketplace
Absu Market is made up of different individual vendors that are trying to grow a thriving community. 
Absu Marketplace is a link to create a network of vendors to help students and community indigens alike eliminate the stress of not knowing what is available in the market. This is especially helpful to students as it helps them effectively utilize their time for other more academic endeavours.
